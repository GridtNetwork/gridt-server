HTTP API Reference
******************

This document describes the HTTP API of the gridt server. For the python API of
the server, see :doc:`pythonapireference`.  We have created an
`openapi <_static/openapi.yaml>`_ document that defines the behaviour of the
server, however for a human readable version we recommend visiting our
`swagger hub page <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Gridt/GridtServer/0.0.1>`_.

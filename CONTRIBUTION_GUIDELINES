# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you so much for considering helping us out. We hope that you will be able to learn a lot while you are here! If you want to contribute to the project, we know of three ways that you could do that.

1. Documentation
2. Testing
3. Writing feature

## Documentation
Before you actually start to code, it might be very useful for you to help us expand our documentation. We go through a lot of effort to document our code as well as possible, but there is always more that you could do. Feel free to ask question about subjects you don't understand yet. Once you know the answer, please write it down so that the awesome coders after you don't have to do the same thing!

## Testing
Once you have a proper understanding of our code, we would really appreciate it if you could assist us with writing tests for our platform. We have laid the fundaments for this, but there is a lot of tests that still can be of much use. Any addittion will be very welcome.

## Writing Features
Once you think you really understand the server and all of it's intricacies you can start to write some additional functionalities. You can request to have an issue assigned to you and we will check your pull requests as quickly as possible!
